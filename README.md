# WFC
WaveFunctionCollapse Project for CMPM 202 W19 - Creation of some artifacts using WFC in Python (using https://github.com/ikarth/wfc_python). Modified samples.xml and sample images added above.   

Sample pixel art images created manually using PixilArt (https://www.pixilart.com/)

# Flat Maps and Terrains:  
Map structure is better preserved with larger tile size (N=3), especially in images with clear boundaries around certain objects.


# Persian Patterns: 
Images with a lot more details ended up being tiled entirely (with N=3. With N=2, tilesize is too small to replicate complex patterns). Simpler patterns lead to more interesting generated artifacts.
